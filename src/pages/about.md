I’m Rajesh, a dedicated tech enthusiast who fell in love with Python after a decade-long journey of tinkering with technology. My adventure began with a spark of curiosity, experimenting with different Linux distributions on my first laptop. Today, I'm focused on conquering the DevOps world, working towards a professional certification from Coursera by IBM.

As [Eric](https://twitter.com/esrtweet) said in his article about [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), I believe the world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. Each challenge presents an opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to making our world a better place. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, designing innovative solutions, or tackling complex issues, the thrill of overcoming obstacles drives me forward. By embracing curiosity and creativity, I am committed to exploring new frontiers and making meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and beyond.

I thrive on creating and contributing. I’ve developed my own Python package and a VS Code extension while actively participating in various open-source projects. My academic background in Physics has deeply influenced my problem-solving approach, with projects that blend coding and real-world challenges, from approximating complex equations to studying environmental recovery.

I live by the mantra, "Never stop learning. Those who stop learning, stop living," which inspires me to share knowledge through my personal website, where I post articles and blogs. When I’m not coding or exploring new concepts, you’ll find me immersed in the thrilling world of Trackmania 2020 or indulging in a movie marathon. I also enjoy exchanging digital letters with my pen pals through [Slowly](https://slowly.app/). This platform simulates the traditional pen pal experience in a modern way, allowing me to teleport to different worlds as I read their letters.

I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals, whether to discuss tech, physics, or share insights. Feel free to reach out—let’s learn and grow together!
